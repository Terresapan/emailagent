{"date":"2025-12-26","digest_type":"daily","briefing":"Here’s a tightened, clearer version of the briefing with clearer structure, sharper curation, and more practical takeaways.\n\nWhat's happening (top points)\n- Benchmarks & capability: ARC-AGI-1/2 are saturated — benchmark designers are pushing tests toward Millennium‑Problem–level math and other unsolved problems to stress frontier models.\n- Capability overhang: OpenAI says model potential currently outstrips typical deployments. Expect stronger pushes to use reasoning models in healthcare, business workflows, and everyday apps in 2026.\n- Labor signal: US programmer employment down ~27.5% over two years — a strong indicator that code-writing roles are shifting, with more automation/agent work replacing some developer tasks.\n- Chips & supply chain: Nvidia is on track to become TSMC’s largest customer in 2026 (~20% of revenue), signaling concentrated demand for AI wafers and supply‑chain pressure.\n- Robotics & automation scaling: Rapid robotic deployments — humanoid Linkerbot assembly demos, Chinese solar farms using robotic arms, and GITAI field tests for outdoor construction work.\n- Bio + ML tools: Columbia researchers demonstrated programmable in‑vivo DNA methylation editing (epigenetic control), showing faster integration of wet‑lab tools with ML-driven workflows.\n- New developer/product tools: Devin (AI teammate that takes tickets, writes code, runs tests, opens PRs), Windsurf (live edit/agent monitoring), TwelveLabs (searchable video summaries), NotebookLM Reports, and Ruby 4.\n- [SPONSORED] DELVE CUA: agent that automates compliance screenshot capture and attachments for controls and audit trails.\n\nWhat this means (practical takeaways)\n- If you run product or engineering: start proof‑of‑concepts that put reasoning models into core workflows (triage, clinical decision support, contract review). The capability overhang means the models are ready — the bottleneck is safe, monitored deployment.\n- For dev teams: plan for agent-assisted development. Build CI hooks, test automation, and PR review flows that include AI-generated changes — and validate outputs with human reviewers and coverage tests.\n- For infra/ops: expect more demand for inference capacity and supply‑chain sensitivity. Consider multi‑vendor wafer/instance strategies and budget for larger GPU/accelerator needs in 2026.\n- For compliance/security: add observability, audit logs, and verifiable artifacts to agent workflows. Evaluate tools like DELVE CUA for automated evidence capture, and require human‑in‑the‑loop gating on high‑risk actions.\n- For product/UX: embed assistants into shared, persistent contexts (group chat, projects, memories). Multi‑user features and workspace memory increase stickiness more than raw model quality.\n- For leadership/HR: prepare workforce transition plans. Upskill teams to supervise, validate, and orchestrate AI agents rather than only to code from scratch.\n- For bio/health teams: treat programmable epigenetic editing as a technology risk/opportunity — coordinate with domain experts and regulatory teams before planning product moves that depend on in‑vivo capabilities.\n\nQuick actions to take this week\n1. Kick off one small POC that adds a reasoning model to an existing workflow (customer triage, code review, or clinical note summarization). Limit scope and define success metrics.\n2. Add agent observability basics: request/response logging, change diffs, and an approval step for any agent that modifies production artifacts.\n3. Revisit vendor/infrastructure exposure: map major suppliers (GPUs/chips) and identify a contingency if a single supplier’s capacity becomes constrained.\n\nTone/accuracy notes\n- Kept claims to what sources report (benchmarks shifting, employment drop, Nvidia/TSMC data, robotics, tools, Columbia bio result).\n- Marked sponsored item explicitly.\n- Avoided speculative leaps about imminent job obsolescence or exaggerated timelines.\n\nIf you want, I can convert the “Quick actions” into a one‑page checklist for your engineering, product, or compliance teams.","linkedin_content":"LinkedIn Post Ideas — TOP 3\n\n1) Topic Title: Turn the Capability Overhang into an Enterprise Edge  \n- Why It Resonates: Founders can capture unused model reasoning today by wiring reasoning agents into one high-value workflow and outperform competitors who wait.  \n- Based on Theme(s): OpenAI capability overhang; deployment gap; reasoning models entering healthcare/business workflows; enterprise deployment tooling.\n\n2) Topic Title: Build Agent‑First Teams as Code Jobs Shrink  \n- Why It Resonates: Hiring only coders risks falling behind — startups that create roles around agents (trainers, reliability, product managers) ship faster with fewer traditional tickets.  \n- Based on Theme(s): Declining programmer employment; SME reliance on AI agents; tools like Devin and Windsurf; automation trends.\n\n3) Topic Title: Make Agents Sticky with Shared Memory & Multi‑User Workspaces  \n- Why It Resonates: Network effects for agents come from shared context and team workflows (memories, multi-user sessions), not just model size — that’s how you get daily reuse.  \n- Based on Theme(s): ChatGPT group chats; Projects & Memories; Windsurf multi-agent sessions; embedding agents into workflows.\n\nFull LinkedIn Posts\n\nPost 1 — Turn the Capability Overhang into an Enterprise Edge\nYour AI can do more than your org asks it to. 🚀🧠\nThere’s a capability overhang in today’s models — they can reason beyond most deployed workflows.\nPick one high-value, low-risk process this quarter.\nExamples: claims triage, invoice reconciliation, clinical note summarization.\nPrototype a reasoning agent in 2–6 weeks:\n1) Define inputs/outputs and success metrics (time saved, error %, approval rate).  \n2) Keep a human in the loop for edge cases.  \n3) Add simple safety checks, logging, and an audit trail.  \nMeasure: aim for 30–50% time reduction or a clear drop in manual errors.\nIf it works, replicate the pattern across adjacent workflows.\nTakeaway: ship one reasoning pilot this quarter. What workflow would you hand to an agent first? Reply below. 📈\n\nPost 2 — Build Agent‑First Teams as Code Jobs Shrink\nHiring only coders is a high-risk play for the next decade. 🤖🛠️\nProgrammer headcount is shifting — agents change who does the work.\nStart redesigning teams now:\n- Create roles: agent trainer (data + prompts), agent reliability engineer (monitoring + fallbacks), agent product manager (workflow integration).  \n- Use tools like Devin for agent dev and Windsurf for multi-agent orchestration.  \n- Invest in prompt design, evaluation frameworks, and rollback procedures.\nMeasure success by faster delivery, fewer traditional tickets, and lower MTTR on agent failures.\nTakeaway: restructure one team for agents this quarter. What role would you hire first? Share one change. 🔁\n\nPost 3 — Make Agents Sticky with Shared Memory & Multi‑User Workspaces\nSticky agents live in your team’s context, not just in a bigger model. 💬🔗\nNetwork effects come from shared memories and multi-user workflows.\nStart small — one project, two weeks:\n1) Add a shared memory for a project (meeting_summaries, decisions, owners, deadlines).  \n2) Have the agent summarize meetings and push action items to your task tracker.  \n3) Track reuse: did teammates call the agent next week?\nConnect the agent to docs and tasks so it becomes the go‑to helper.\nMeasure retention and repeat usage — small shared wins compound into real network effects.\nTakeaway: build one shared memory and test reuse in 2 weeks.

Up to 20 people can now collaborate with ChatGPT in shared conversations across all plan tiers: Free, Go, Plus, and Pro.\r\n\r\n**The feature works like you'd expect:** \r\n\r\n* Tap the people icon, share an invite link, and everyone can chat together with ChatGPT jumping in when needed. \r\n\r\n* You can @ mention it for responses, set custom instructions for tone, and ChatGPT even reacts with emojis. \r\n\r\n* Privacy-first design means your personal memory stays separate from group chats.\r\n\r\nEarly feedback from pilot markets shows strong adoption for specific use cases like research teams and trip planning, but questions remain about scaling beyond small groups.\r\n\r\n**Our Experience:** We tested it out on one of our lives the other day, and had a about 6 of us chatting at one point. Samuel joined from Nairobi, Corey was in St. Louis, and ChatGPT calculated we were 8,150 miles apart in the chat; then we had it tell us it would take a triathlete 23 days nonstop to cover that distance.\r\n\r\nI didn't really get the appeal at first. ChatGPT wouldn't shut up unless we explicitly @ mentioned it, which got annoying. But goofing off with friends while an intelligent AI bot chimed in? That was genuinely fun; like having a smart Discord bot or Reddit reply bot you can summon on command.\r\n\r\nThe problem? The ultimate form factor for this _isn't_ ChatGPT… it's _iMessage_, where I'm already texting my friends. OpenAI needs to figure out how to get ChatGPT into my existing messaging apps, not ask me to move my entire social life into their app.\r\n\r\n**Here's why this matters:** The Information [recently reported](https://www.theinformation.com/articles/openais-organizational-problems-hurt-chatgpt) that OpenAI leaders are concerned the average user won't see much difference between ChatGPT and Gemini. \r\n\r\nMore importantly, they noted that chatbots fundamentally lack the network effects that made Facebook and Instagram sticky, as those apps got better as more people joined; you can think of it as FB and IG being multiplayer games, while GPT is mostly single player… _until NOW… ish. _\r\n\r\n**See, OpenAI's tried building network effects before: **\r\n\r\n* Remember the GPT store? IMO it never really panned out, and now GPTs in general feel mostly deprecated with connectors and skills. \r\n\r\n* Sora [hit 1M downloads](https://techcrunch.com/2025/10/09/sora-hit-1m-downloads-faster-than-chatgpt/) faster than ChatGPT, and it's since found a loyal yet niche following… but unless I missed it, nowhere near mass adoption. \r\n\r\n* The new [Apps marketplace](https://chatgpt.com/apps/) just launched, and remains to be seen whether it’ll create the stickiness OpenAI needs.\r\n\r\nIMO, the _actual_ network effects in AI come from **Projects** (Claude's killer feature, which GPT also has) and **Memories** (ChatGPT's killer feature, which Claude also has). \r\n\r\nPersonally, I keep going back to Claude because that's where my projects with all my daily tasks live: it's my hub. For me, ChatGPT and Gemini are better for one-off questions and tasks, but Claude owns my workflow because of Projects. Other people feel the same way about ChatGPT Memories. [_Thanks for the memories_](https://youtu.be/onzL0EM1pKY?si=KFmFjj-2rjIjoM0m&t=88)_, sorry that they’re stuck in GPT! _\r\n\r\n**So really, what would it take to build real network effects into AI assistants?** Here are a few ideas:\r\n\r\n1. **iMessage integration**: Turn ChatGPT into a bot you can call in your existing group chats, not a separate app.\r\n\r\n2. **AI-first marketplace?**: Imagine a Facebook Marketplace competitor where your AI agent finds items others are selling based on your preferences.\r\n\r\n3. **YouTube-style playable features**: YouTube recently added playable games. What if ChatGPT had persistent, multiplayer experiences you could only access through the platform? That’s something I’d group chat about. \r\n\r\n4. **OpenAI's rumored hardware device**: A physical device that makes ChatGPT your default interface could create lock-in, especially if there’s a multiplayer component (_new communication interface to chat w/ friends?)_\r\n\r\n5. **Collaborative workspaces that persist**: What if ChatGPT hosted persistent team workspaces that accumulated shared knowledge over time? _Right now, I’d settle for a Canvas file that doesn’t get context constrained… _\r\n\r\n**Why this matters:** AI companies are realizing chatbots alone won't create defensible moats. The winner won't be the smartest model; it'll be whoever figures out how to embed AI into either A) the workflows and social networks we can't quit, or B) new workflows that are even better than previous ones. \r\n\r\nView image: (https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/7cf99573-4593-460e-bb90-7154a8d863f4/image.png?t=1765839774)\r\nCaption: \r\n\r\n**FROM OUR PARTNERS**\r\n\r\n# Your last video edit took 4 hours.
