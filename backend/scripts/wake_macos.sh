# Script to wake macOS at 6:58 AM from Monday to Friday
# This can be configured using pmset on macOS or other wake mechanisms

# Note: This script is a placeholder. The actual wake mechanism depends on your setup.
# For macOS, you would typically use pmset to schedule wake:
# sudo pmset repeat wake MTWRF 06:58:00

# Alternative: Use caffeinate to prevent sleep during execution
# caffeinate -i /path/to/main.py
